Publish files from an app's `assets/` directory with SHA-256 URLs that remain stable across deployments. Resolve files with `assetUrl()` from `patchsmith/client` or Vite `?url` imports. Deployments track their asset references and reuse existing uploads. Each deployment supports up to 256 static assets, including logos. Static files share the 10 MiB deployment budget with client code and server code before and after compression, including reused assets. Upgrade the platform database and backend, then the host SDK, before deploying apps with assets.

Breaking: logos now reference files inside `assets/`, using paths such as `logos: { light: "logo-light.svg", dark: "logo-dark.svg" }`. Move logo files into `assets/` and remove the directory prefix from config. Logos use the same hashed URLs, deployment references, uploads, verification, and size accounting as other assets; a file used by both variants counts once. The deployment API accepts logo paths instead of separate file metadata and no longer returns dedicated logo uploads. Old logo URLs and deployment logo file references are removed; redeploy apps after upgrading.
